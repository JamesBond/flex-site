The Apache Flex Installer is a tool that simplifies the download and installation of the Apache Flex SDK and its (required) components. It is aimed at anyone who wants to use the latest release of the Apache Flex SDK, but who might not necessarily be familiar with the tools and procedures required to compile the Apache Flex SDK from source code. 

The tool is provided as a convenience download, and is not an official release.  However, it will grab the official, current release of the SDK from Apache.org, install it onto your computer and prepare it for use with Adobe Flash Builder.

Use the Apache Flex Installer Badge below to download the application and start using the latest and greatest Apache Flex SDK:
