## Timeline of Apache Flex incubation

The goal of this page is to document the history of the Apache Flex incubation, starting with Adobe 
deciding to donate it to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).

It might be useful for other similar projects, or any incubating project, as an example of what's needed to 
incubate at Apache. 

See [http://incubator.apache.org](http://incubator.apache.org) for the official Incubator documentation, and
in particular the [incubation process description](http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Process_Description.html) page.

##2012: Adobe decides to contribute Flex to the ASF

The decision is made to incubate Flex at the ASF. Work starts on the incubation proposal, on explaining
internally what this means, on the legal/IP clearance steps required to donate the code and on recruiting 
initial committers who will help get the project started.

##December 12th, 2011: Flex Summit

The [Flex Summit](http://tv.adobe.com/show/flex-community-summit-december-2011) is organized to make
the Flex community aware of the upcoming changes, and to allow initial Flex committers to sign up and network.

Among the available videos, these two provide interesting insights on how Apache projects work, by Roy Fielding,
one of the ASF's founders:

  - [What it means to be an Apache project, part 1](http://tv.adobe.com/watch/flex-community-summit-december-2011/what-it-means-to-be-an-apache-project-part-1/)
  - [What it means to be an Apache project, part 2](http://tv.adobe.com/watch/flex-community-summit-december-2011/what-it-means-to-be-an-apache-project-part-2/)

The following blog posts provide other views on the event, and show that it was useful for the Flex community
and for the upcoming Apache Flex project:

 - [Flex given to the Apache Software Foundation – round-up and opportunities](http://www.flex-tutorial.fr/2011/12/17/flex-given-to-the-apache-software-foundation-round-up-and-opportunities)
 - [Huge Adobe Partnership to Open Source Flex with Apache Software Foundation …](http://www.adamflater.net/2011/12/14/apache-flex-beginning/)

##December 20th:  incubation proposal submitted

The [Incubation proposal](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/FlexProposal) is submitted
and [discussed](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201112.mbox/%3CCB14DCA2.3885F%25aharui%40adobe.com%3E) on the incubator-general mailing list, followed after a few days (once the 
discussions dies down) by the Incubator PMC vote mentioned below.

The list of incubation mentors is completed during the proposal's discussion phase, after asking for volunteers
when submitting the proposal.

A few initial committers are also added during the discussion phase.

##December 22nd, vote for Anne and Dave as incubator PMC members
Project mentors need to be members of the Incubator PMC, ASF members just need to ask to get this membership.

Committers who are not (yet) Apache members need to be voted in by the Incubator PMC, which was done
around December 22 for Anne and Dave.

##December 27th, [VOTE] Flex to join the Apache Incubator

The [Incubator PMC vote](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201112.mbox/%3CCB14DCA2.3885F%25aharui%40adobe.com%3E) 
lasts at least 72 hours, after which whoever started it
[tallies it](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201112.mbox/%3CCAEWfVJmMq390Hinafg%2Bjik8VqboYG1ixe_gnz5O2bV5q5mtKPw%40mail.gmail.com%3E).
the vote for Flex passes on December 30th.

## Late December 2011, basic infrastructure is created

See for example the 
[INFRA-4260](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-4260) (create mailing lists)
and
[INFRA-4262](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-4262) (create JIRA instance)
issues.

Flex is added to the Incubator's [reporting schedule](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/ReportingSchedule).

The [Flex incubation status page](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex.html) is created.

People are invited to subscribe to the new Apache Flex [mailing lists](/flex/mailing-lists.html)

Those lists are added to [flex.markmail.org](http://flex.markmail.org) for convenience, using the markmail feedback form.

Discussions and consensus building start, including clarifications about the role of the PPMC, committers
and community, whether to create roadmaps or just let things evolve organically, etc.

##Late 2011 and early 2012: user accounts
Mentors request creation of Apache accounts for the initial committers listed in the
[incubation proposal](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/FlexProposal), after asking people which Apache ID
they would like, avoiding collisions with [existing IDs](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html).

Initial committers, who are also PPMC members, are invited to subscribe to the Flex private mailing list 
(which is used for discussions about people, new committers etc. and as little as possible besides that) and 
made aware of the [Apache guide for new committers](http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html).

##January 17th, 2012: software grant received

Adobe's [software grant](http://www.apache.org/licenses/software-grant.txt) is received by the ASF's 
secretary, the Flex code can now be imported into Apache Flex's code repository.

##Feb 16th, Adobe's roadmap for Flex

[Adobe's view of Flex and its commitments to Flex in the future](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/whitepapers/roadmap.html) is
published, helps explain how it intends to collaborate with Flex.

##February 22nd: a new committer
Justin Mclean is the first Flex committer to be voted in, after a short discussion and a vote on the Flex private 
mailing list, as per the [incubator's instructions](http://incubator.apache.org/guides/ppmc.html).

##March 27th: MXMLC donation announced
The legal/IP clearance work for that module is done on the Adobe side, that code is ready to be donated.

##TODO
- pointers to svn and JIRA import, JIRA issues
- logo contest
