The Apache Flex Installer (AFI) is a utility for downloading and installing the artifacts and dependencies needed to use the Apache Flex SDK with a third party IDE. 

The official release of the AFI is the source which can be found [here][1] or [here (SVN)][2]. It is recommended that you download the officially released source distribution of the AFI and that you verify the downloaded file before opening it.

The AFI is also made available as a convenience binary [here][1] and through the [Apache Flex Installer Badge][3]. This binary is not the official release.

NOTE: the AFI downloads the binaries of the Apache Flex SDK. These binaries are provided as a convenience for those who do not wish to compile the SDK themselves. They are not the official release of the SDK. The official release of the SDK is the source release, which can be found [here][4] or [here (SVN)][5]. It is recommended that you download the official release of the SDK and that you verify the downloaded file before opening it.
