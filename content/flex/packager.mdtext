The Apache Flex SDK IDE Packager is a tool that allows a single-click download of the Apache Flex SDK and all of its required components.  It is useful for those who are not familiar with the required build tools required to make or compile your own SDK. 

The tool is provided as a convince download, and is not an official release.  However, it will grab the official, current release from Apache and install it onto your computer, and prepare the SDK for use with your favorite IDE such as Adobe Flash Builder, JetBrains IntelliJ as well as many others.

The tool will be posted here once it has been tested and released.  In the mean time, you are free to download the source code [on our SVN](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/flex/utilities/InstallApacheFlex/).
