##Apache Flex Re-branding Initiative (Logo Contest - complete)

On the 31th of December, 2011, the Apache Software Foundation has accepted the 
Flex SDK into incubation. Apache Flex is now a community project managed by 
Apache (ASF). The migration from Adobe to Apache involves a re-branding, 
and we have came to a decision through a joint vote with PPMC members and 
the community at large.

See the logo contest's page with results [here][2].

Congratulations to the winner, Adrian Knopik of Fuse Collective, for his [logo][3]
submitted by Tomasz MaciÄ…g.

Congratulations to the runner up, Julien Brehier, for his [logo proposal][4].
